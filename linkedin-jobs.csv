Starting with helping Dashers with unexpected life expenses (e.g. car needs repair) that prevent them from earning. From there help Dashers grow their personal P&amp;L and then unlock their life goals from buying a new car to buying a house.</li><li>Dasher Pay and Experience - Ensure that Dashers have the flexibility they need to make informed decisions on which orders to take. Do this while ensuring that Consumer orders are delivered at high quality despite varying preferences from Dashers on which orders they want to take. Pay should be fair and equitable for all Dashers.</li><li>Dasher Growth - Make Dashing relevant and compelling to anyone. As an individual looking for flexible ways to earn, Dashing should be the most compelling value proposition. From there help applicants get on the road and get their first $1 in their pocket in minutes.</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>Logistics</strong> -<p><br/></p><ul><li>On-a-Dash - From the time the Dasher accepts the order to the time it\'s delivered, help Dashers be as efficient as possible. Dashers should never wait at the store and drop-offs at the consumer should be seamless regardless of if you\'re delivering to a single family home or 20 story apartment complex.</li><li>Fleet Excellence - Ensure that DoorDash has the highest quality gig fleet on the planet. Consumers should choose DoorDash because our Dasher\'s go above and beyond and always take care of the customer. Do this in a way where Dashers feel rewarded for delivering at high quality.</li><li>Dashforce - Create new earnings opportunities for Dashers by enabling them to do more than one type of job. Enable Merchants to lever a massive pool of flexible labor for tasks like shopping or filling prescriptions. Dashers that choose to should have no problem working DoorDash as a primary source of income.</li><li>Consumer Demand Shaping - Operate at the intersection of new ordering use cases for Consumers AND driving more batches. For example, giving Consumers the opportunity to pre-schedule meals that have planned routes that set the standard of Driver efficiency. Then do that again.</li><li>Dispatch - Enable the fastest and most efficient assignments. No matter what we\'re delivering -- could be paper towels, groceries and hot food in the same car DoorDash should be making the best assignment decision for Consumers, Merchants, Dashers and DoorDash.</li><li>Merchant Logistics - Be the merchant\'s ""Chief Operating Officer in a Box"" who handles the nitty gritty of running an efficient, profitable, and defect free operation so that they can focus on creating amazing food. Your success will be measured by merchant defects like missing/incorrect items, dasher wait and whether we are the merchant\'s operating partner of choice.</li><li>Supply and Demand - You are ensuring the balance of the marketplace. Every order should have an available Dasher but at the same time every Dasher should be getting orders non-stop. We should be as cost efficient as possible in enabling this balance, getting the perfect amount of Dashers to the right place at the right time.</li><li>International Logistics - Every country is fundamentally different in what Logistics needs to look like to win. From labor laws, to how merchants operate to whether deliveries are done on bikes vs. cars our logistics strategy and roadmap needs to change to deliver quality and efficiency in that market. As the intl logistics lead you will ensure that logistics in every country is built to win that country.</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>Bundles</strong> -<p><br/></p><ul><li>DoubleDash - Own the post-checkout experience of bundling desserts, alcohol, food, drinks and paper towels onto your order. Own the #1 way Consumers will discover and enjoy new verticals at DoorDash. Drive the roadmap for an entirely new way to shop all the way to a smooth delivery from two distinct Merchants to the same</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>About The Role</strong><p><br/></p>The Dasher &amp; Logistics teams exist to power high-quality and efficient deliveries while building the best gig platform on the planet. We have 3 commitments forever that require a team of rockstar Product Managers to solve for:<p><br/></p><ul><li>For Dashers - we are providing financial stability and mobility for anyone on the planet. Today ~40% of adults can\'t cover an unexpected $400 expense. We are building the gig experience that has your back regardless of your financial situation, builds your personal P&amp;L over time and unlocks your life goals faster.</li><li>For Consumers - we ensure that anytime you order you are wow\'d by the speed and quality of the delivery experience. Never late, no missing items, food delivered at the highest quality from a delightful Dasher. We introduce unexpected moments of delight in your shopping journey like bundling a dessert with your entree to go above and beyond what consumers expect from delivery today.</li><li>For DoorDash - we own all the costs of fulfillment and reduce those costs by driving Dasher efficiency. We drive efficiency by ensuring that there is 0 wasted time on any order and that we are constantly shaping consumer demand in a way that unlocks more batches.</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>We\'re Excited About You Because\xe2\x80\xa6</strong><p><br/></p><ul><li>You have a track record of impact - you\'ve been in the trenches and have a proven track record of driving significant, company-wide impact</li><li>You have a bias to action and agility - you move quickly and thrive in a fast-paced environment. No job is beneath you and you lead from the front.</li><li>You ""break through walls"" mentality - you are always pushing the envelope of what is possible and can figure out a way to make almost anything happen. You\'re a playmaker.</li><li>You have 2+ years of Product Management experience</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>About DoorDash</strong><p><br/></p>At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users\xe2\x80\x94from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.<p><br/></p>DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We\'re committed to supporting employees\xe2\x80\x99 happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.<p><br/></p><strong>Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion</strong><p><br/></p>We\xe2\x80\x99re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.
